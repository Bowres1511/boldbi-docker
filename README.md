# Bold BI on Docker

Bold BI can be deployed using docker-compose. Nginx will be running in a separate container as reverse proxy to route traffic to other containers. Please follow the below steps to deploy Bold BI using docker-compose deployment.

Download the configuration files [here](deploy/). This directory includes docker-compose YML file and configuration file for nginx.

## docker-compose changes

1. Open **docker-compose.yml** file from the downloaded files. Replace your DNS or IP address on which you are going to access the application in `<application_base_url>` place.
    
    Ex: `http://example.com`, `https://example.com`, `http://<ip_address>`

2. Read the optional client library license agreement from the following link.

    [Consent to deploy client libraries](consent-to-deploy-client-libraries.md)

3. Note the optional client libraries from the above link as comma separated names and replace it in `<comma_separated_library_names>` place. Save the file after the required values has been replaced.

4. Provide **default.conf** file path in `<default_conf_path>` place.

    Ex: `"./default.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf"`
        `"D:/boldbi/docker/default.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf"`
        `"/var/boldbi/docker/default.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf"`

5. Allocate a directory in your host machine to store the shared folders for applicationsâ€™ usage. Replace the directory path with `<host_path>` in **docker-compose.yml** file.

    Ex: `device: 'D:/boldbi/shared'`
        `device: '/var/boldbi/shared'`

## Configure SSL
If you have an SSL certificate for your domain and need to configure the site with your SSL certificate, follow these steps or you can skip this.

1. Uncomment the following marked lines in the **default.conf** file.

    ![ssl configuration](images/uncomment_lines.png)

2. Comment the following marked line in the **default.conf** file.

    ![ssl configuration](images/comment_lines.png)

3. Uncomment the following marked lines in the **docker-compose.yml** file.
    
    ![ssl configuration](images/uncomment_docker.png)

4. Replace certificate and key file paths from your host machine in `<ssl_cert_file_path>` and `<ssl_key_file_path>` places on **docker-compose.yml** file.

    Ex: `- "D:/certificates/boldbi.crt:/etc/ssl/domain.crt"`
        `- "/var/mycertificates/boldbi.crt:/etc/ssl/domain.crt"`

        `- "D:/certificates/boldbi.key:/etc/ssl/domain.crt"`
        `- "/var/mycertificates/boldbi.key:/etc/ssl/domain.crt"`

> **NOTE:** If you are configuring the application with SSL, you need update the `<application_base_url>` in the **docker-compose.yml** with `HTTPS`.
